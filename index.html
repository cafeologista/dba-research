        <h2>About the Study</h2>
        <p>
          This doctoral research explores how Property &amp; Casualty (P&amp;C) insurance organizations integrate
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Kaizen-based continuous improvement practices. It examines leadership
          strategy, change management, communication, and cultural alignment through frameworks such as TOE,
          McKinsey 7-S, and ADKAR—aiming to identify practical approaches that support operational excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Findings are used strictly for academic purposes and reported in aggregate. No individual or
          organization will be identified without explicit authorization.
